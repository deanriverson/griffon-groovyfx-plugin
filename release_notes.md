What's New in Version 0.4
=========================
The GroovyFX plugin now resolves the jfxrt.jar file so that it can be used without the JavaFX plugin.

What's New in Version 0.3
=========================
This version of the plugin updates the underlying GroovyFX version to 0.2, which requires JavaFX 2.1
(Developer's Preview).
